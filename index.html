	  <p> largest city in the Northern District of Israel. 
	  Nazareth is known as "the Arab capital of Israel".
	  In 2019 its population was 77,445.[1] The inhabitants are predominantly Arab  
	  <div id="special_style">citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian.</div>
	  Nof HaGalil (formerly "Nazareth Illit"), declared a separate city in June 1974,
	  is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014.<br>
	  In the New Testament, the town is described as the childhood home of Jesus, and as such is a center of 
	  Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events. As the largest Arab city in Israel, Nazareth is 
	  a cultural, political, religious, economic and commercial center of the Arab citizens of Israel, and became also a center 
	  of Arab and Palestinian nationalism.</p>
	  <hr>
	  <p><span style="color:red">One view holds that "Nazareth" is derived from one of the Hebrew words for 'branch', namely ne·ṣer, ‏נֵ֫צֶר‎,[9] and alludes to 
	  the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1, 'from (Jesse's) roots a Branch (netzer) will bear fruit'.</span>
	  One view suggests this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile.[10] Alternatively, the name may derive
	  from the verb na·ṣar, נָצַר, "watch, guard, keep," and understood either in the sense of "watchtower" or "guard place", implying the early
	  town was perched on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position.
	  The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.<br>
	  Another theory holds that the Greek form Ναζαρά (Nazará), used in Matthew and Luke, may derive from an earlier Aramaic form of the name,
	  or from another Semitic language form. If there were a tsade (צ) in the original Semitic form, as in the later Hebrew forms, it would
	  normally have been transcribed in Greek with a sigma (σ) instead of a zeta (ζ). This has led some scholars to question whether "Nazareth"
	  and its cognates in the New Testament actually refer to the settlement known traditionally as Nazareth in Lower Galilee. Such linguistic
	  discrepancies may be explained, however, by "a peculiarity of the 'Palestinian' Aramaic dialect wherein a sade (ṣ) between two voiced (sonant)
	  consonants tended to be partially assimilated by taking on a zayin (z) sound".</p>
